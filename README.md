#### PiCar-X: Component Design and Initial Implementation
This section discussses the design of the component, the implementaion of a command to start/stop the PiCar-X to move and detect objects, and the sending of events. First, proceed to initial ground testing before finishing the implementation in the later sections.

### Component Design

In order for the PiCar-X to move and detect objects autonomously, it needs to accept commands for movement and obstacle avoidance, and control the motors and sensors using the Robot HAT library, which abstracts the lower-level hardware interfaces. The system leverages F Prime ports to communicate with the motor, camera, and ultrasonic sensor modules. A rate group input port is used to schedule periodic tasksâ€”such as updating movement commands and polling sensor data.

The PiCar-X system will contain three key components:

- MotorController: Handles moving forward, stopping, and speed control.
- CameraHandler: Captures images and logs image capture status.
- UltrasonicSensor: Reads distance to obstacles and reports data to telemetry.
Each component will send Robot HAT commands via Python scripts rather than interacting with GPIO/I2C.

Additionally, standard F Prime ports are defined for:

- Commands: To trigger actions like moving the vehicle, stopping, capturing an image, or reading sensor data.
- Telemetry: To report the status of each component, including motor speed, obstacle detection, and camera capture status.
- Events: To log significant system actions, such as movement state changes, image capture events, and detected obstacles.
- Parameters: To allow runtime adjustments of settings like motor speed, obstacle detection threshold, and camera capture mode.
- ExecPython: A dedicated port for invoking Python scripts, which interact with Robot HAT APIs for motor, camera, and sensor control.

This component design is captured in the block diagram below, with input ports on the left and output ports on the right. Ports for standard F Prime functions (e.g., commands, events, telemetry, and parameters) are highlighted in green, while the ExecPython port (used for triggering external scripts) is specially integrated.

#### Design Summary

### Component Ports
- run: Invoked at a set rate from the rate group, used to control movement, camera panning, and obstacle detection.
- execPython: Triggers external Python scripts that interface with the Robot HAT library to execute movement, object detection, and obstacle avoidance.
- Standard component ports (circled in green) are not explicitly listed here.

|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------|

| **UltrasonicSensor**| `OBSTACLE_THRESHOLD` | Defines **distance threshold** for obstacle avoidance. |

---

## **ExecPython: Running Individual Python Scripts for Each Component**
Instead of writing a single **integrated Python script**, we will **let FPrime execute three separate scripts simultaneously**:

| **Component**        | **ExecPython Script**   | **Function** |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **MotorController** | `movement.py`        | Handles **movement, speed, and direction**. |
| **CameraHandler**   | `object_detection.py` | Controls **camera panning and tilting**. |
| **UltrasonicSensor**| `avoiding_obstacles.py` | Manages **obstacle detection and avoidance**. |

By calling all three scripts in parallel, FPrime will ensure that movement, camera tracking, and obstacle detection happen simultaneously without needing a combined script.

## Define Component Commands, Events, Telemetry in '.fpp' Files

Each component now has a directory in 'Components/'. Open each '.fpp' file inside its directory.

### 1. To generate the implemention files after defining the '.fpp' files, run:
```
fprime-util impl
```

This will generate:
- MotorController.template.cpp and MotorController.template.hpp
- CameraHandler.template.cpp and CameraHandler.template.hpp
- UltrasonicSensor.template.cpp and UltrasonicSensor.template.hpp

Rename them by removing '.template' from them:
```
mv MotorController.template.cpp MotorController.cpp
mv MotorController.template.hpp MotorController.hpp

mv CameraHandler.template.cpp CameraHandler.cpp
mv CameraHandler.template.hpp CameraHandler.hpp

mv UltrasonicSensor.template.cpp UltrasonicSensor.cpp
mv UltrasonicSensor.template.hpp UltrasonicSensor.hpp
```

### 2. Build and Validate the files

Run:
```
fprime-util build
```
If everything compiles correctly, your FPrime components are now ready to integrate into the system topology.

### 3.
