## PiCar-X: Component Design and Initial Implementation
This section discussses the design of the component, the implementaion of a command to start/stop the PiCar-X to move and detect objects. 

### Component Design

For autonomous operation, PiCar-X uses FPrime components to manage motor movements, camera operations, and object detection via the Robot HAT library (no direct GPIO/I2C interactions).

The PiCar-X system will contain the component:

- ObjectDetector:
  - Custom UDP-based component.
  - Sends triggers via UDP (1 to start, 0 to stop) to PiCar-X (IP: 192.168.1.99, Port: 6000).
  - Receives UDP detection logs and records them as FPrime events.

The component will send Robot HAT commands via Python scripts rather than interacting with GPIO and I2C.

Communication within the system leverages FPrime ports:

- Commands: Initiate actions (move, stop).

- Telemetry: Report statuses.

- Events: Log system events.

- Parameters: Adjust operational settings dynamically.

### Supported Commands
| **Command**       | **Description**                                 | **UDP Message** | **PiCar-X IP:Port** |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `StartDetection`  | Initiate object detection and PiCar-X movement. | `"1"`           | `192.168.1.99:6000` |
| `StopDetection`   | Stop object detection and halt PiCar-X movement.| `"0"`           | `192.168.1.99:6000` |


This component design is captured in the block diagram below.

## Install Robot Hat and its necessary dependencies

1. Connect to WiFi using the wpa_supplicant.config file.
2. Enable I2C on Raspberry Pi.
3. Install all modules for Robot Hat

Refer the official website to install it properly. https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/play_with_python.html

## Create the components

Go to the terminal, navigate to the project's root directory and run 
```
# In PiCar-X
cd Components
fprime-util new --component
```

You will be prompted for the information regarding your component. Fill out the prompts as shown below:
### ObjectDetector Component

Generate implementation files? (yes/no) [yes]: yes
Refreshing cache and generating implementation files...
[INFO] Created new component and generated initial implementations.
```

## Define Component Commands, Events, Telemetry in '.fpp' Files

The component now has a directory in 'Components/'. Open the '.fpp' file inside its directory.

### 1. To generate the implemention files after defining the '.fpp' files, run:
```
fprime-util impl
```

This will generate:
- ObjectDetector.template.cpp and ObjectDetector.template.hpp

Rename them by removing '.template' from them:
```
mv ObjectDetector.template.cpp ObjectDetector.cpp
mv ObjectDetector.template.hpp ObjectDetector.hpp

```

### 2. Build and Validate the files

Run:
```
fprime-util build
```
If everything compiles correctly, your FPrime component is now ready to integrate into the system topology.

## Create a deployment
Go to the terminal, navigate to the project's root directory and run 
```
# In PiCar-X
cd 
fprime-util new --deployment
```

You will be prompted for the information regarding your component. Fill out the prompts as shown below:
### ObjectDetector Deployment
```
[INFO] Cookiecutter source: using builtin
  [1/2] Deployment name (MyDeployment): MyDeployment
  [2/2] Select communication driver type
    1 - TcpClient
    2 - TcpServer

    Choose from [1/2/3] (1): 1
[INFO] Found CMake file at 'PiCarUDP/project.cmake'
Add MyDeployment to PiCarUDP/project.cmake at end of file? (yes/no) [yes]:yes
```

Edit the instances.fpp and topology.fpp files to include the objectDetector instance and connections for MyDeployment.

Once saved, use
```
fprime-util build
```

If built, with no errors, proceed to use Ground Data System using
```
fprime-util gds --ip-port 6000
```

## Running the PiCar-X Python Detection Script

Follow these steps to run the PiCar-X object detection system alongside the FPrime UI:

1. **Start the Detection Script**  
   Open a new terminal on the Raspberry Pi and run the detection script.  
   This script listens on **UDP port 6000** for start/stop triggers from the FPrime system:

   ```
   python3 object_detection.py
   ```

2. **Trigger Detection via FPrime UI**
In the FPrime Ground UI:
- Navigate to the StartDetection command
- Set the trigger value to 1
This instructs the PiCar-X to start moving and performing real-time object detection

3. **View Detection Logs**
The PiCar-X uses YOLOv11 to detect objects in real time.
Detection events will be displayed in the FPrime UI log view.
ðŸ”— Learn more about the model here: [Ultralytics YOLOv11 Overview](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/#overview)

4. **Stop the Detection Process**
In the FPrime Ground UI:
- Navigate to the StopDetection command in the FPrime UI
- Set the trigger value to 0
This stops the PiCar-X's movement and detection logic
